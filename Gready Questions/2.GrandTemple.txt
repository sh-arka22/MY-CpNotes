Problem Name: Grand Temple
Problem Difficulty: None
Problem Constraints: 1 <=  N <= 10^5 <br>
| Ai | <= 10^9
Problem Description:
A religious king wants to build the largest temple in his kingdom . To build the largest temple he needs to find the area of the largest suitable land . Given co-ordinates which denotes rivers flowing through the point horizontally as well as vertically , find the largest area possible to make the grand temple. <br>
Consider 2 rivers flowing across x-axis as well as y-axis. The temple must be enclosed by rivers on all 4 sides.
